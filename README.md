# Personal-Grocery-Project
A project I started back in 2020 due to the rising prices and the pandemic, I wanted to see the trends of groceries across time.

This will be an analysis and the end goal will be to create a customized analysis at the end when I finally finish looking through all the different data. No modeling here, just straight up analysis.
