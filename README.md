# Personal-Grocery-Project
A project I started back in 2020 due to the rising prices and the pandemic, I wanted to see the trends of groceries across time.

This will be an analysis and the end goal will be to create a customized analysis at the end when I finally finish looking through all the different data. No modeling here, just straight up analysis. 

For more information about this project, how it started, and my process on it and how things are going, please check out https://thedatarranger.wordpress.com/!
